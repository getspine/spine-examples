[Wekan](https://wekan.io/) is a Trello-like task tracking tool from sandstorm.io, backed by MongoDB.

How to Run
==========

1. Deploy the Backbone file:

```
spine deploy
```

**PLEASE NOTE**: This deployment requests a Let's Encrypt certificate, which will make the initial Balancer deploy take longer than usual.

2. Visit ```https://wekan-<your subdomain>.spi.ne```
